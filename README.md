# Domain Generalization

This repository contains code, experiments, and reports for **EE5102/CS6302 - Advanced Topics in Machine Learning, Assignment 1: Deep Models and Domain Generalization**. The focus is on exploring how modern deep learning models generalize across domains, particularly in handling **Out-of-Distribution (OOD)** data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Domain generalization is a critical challenge in machine learning, where models trained on one distribution must perform well on unseen domains. This repo implements tasks that study **covariate shift**, **semantic shift**, **inductive biases**, and **robustness** through a combination of **discriminative, contrastive, and generative models**.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and evaluate **covariate vs. semantic (concept) shift**  
- Explore **model biases** (shape, texture, color, locality)
