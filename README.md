# Domain Generalization

This repository contains code, experiments, and reports of Deep Models and Domain Generalization. The focus is on exploring how modern deep learning models generalize across domains, particularly in handling **Out-of-Distribution (OOD)** data.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Domain generalization is a critical challenge in machine learning, where models trained on one distribution must perform well on unseen domains. This repo implements tasks that study **covariate shift**, **semantic shift**, **inductive biases**, and **robustness** through a combination of **discriminative, contrastive, and generative models**.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understand and evaluate **covariate vs. semantic (concept) shift**  
- Explore **model biases** (shape, texture, color, locality)
